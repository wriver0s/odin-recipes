    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TThis means Huancainan-style potato and comes from Huancayo, Peru. It's an easy-to-make dish of sliced potatoes with a special sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste/li>
            <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion until tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Boil chile peppers until soft, about 5 minutes. Run chiles under cold water to cool until cool enough to handle; remove and discard skins.</li>          
            <li>Blend onion, chile peppers, cheese, vegetable oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender until smooth. Stream evaporated milk into the blended mixture while continuing to blend until a creamy sauce is achieved.</li>
