    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Peruvian rice and chicken dish 
        made with cilantro and a special Peruvian kick.</p> 
        <p>It's very delicious, my Peruvian father-in-law said
         that mine was even better then his sister's - 
         who is one of the best cooks in the family (
            besides my mother-in-law)! 
        Goes great with Huancaina sauce and salsa Criolla EDIT EDIT.</p>
    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut in half </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Â½ cup chicken broth</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat with enough oil to coat the bottom. Brown chicken in the hot oil on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes total. Remove chicken onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour more oil into the pan and add onion; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cilantro, chile paste, salt, and pepper and saute until cilantro turns dark green, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and deglaze, scraping the browned bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Bring to a light simmer; let simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture carefully to an electric blender and puree.</li>
